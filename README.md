# Task-1 : TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
âœ“ Titanic dataset is used to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived
# Task-3 : IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor,
and virginica.Iris dataset is used to develop a model that can classify iris
flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal
measurements.
# Task-4 : SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON
Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that
customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as
advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and
